The first ever CTF challenge I wrote, for BroncoCTF 2023.

## Challenge Description:

A hundred people are at this hacking party, and we have a program to search for people there. 
I heard that a prankster wants to jumpscare five people at the party while they are busy coding. We think he may have left some evidence in the search program. Can you help us figure out who the prankster is targeting?

Tip: The flag is in the form broncoctf{Name1Name2Name3...} where a "Name" is a person at the party, case sensitive, joined together with no space.
